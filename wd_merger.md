## RCB - WD merger
* ?? entropy injection - Courtney task: does this work? Does it take too long? Can we speed it up?
* Give them an entropy injection routine - could maybe write a functional form if it’s not too complicated
* Evolve a normal star first - could be given to speed up, but it really doesn’t take long
* Give them abundances - unless change M and q??
* Evolve to RCB phase ? could take forever - lower some resolutions - could turn off reactions???? - super adiabatic reduction new thing in MESA for slowdown
* Needs work - could be abandoned
* Could this be also accretion - a lot of work on us but would be cool!
