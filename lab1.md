Here is the text for lab 1

## Run binary as point mass - goal is to get Mdot as a function of time
* Start from an inlist that we give them for a generic binary, then changing the parameters: component masses and separation
* Run speedup options - could be given or asked to add in
* Ask them to save to history file the Mdot and time (visualize this in pgstar - write their own pgstar with history data)
* Claudia task: run a few and play around
* Main concern is runtime for some parameters, solver may struggle
* Science goal: connect types of donors to Mdot and Mdot to thickness of Helium shell
