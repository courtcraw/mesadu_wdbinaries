Here is the text for lab 3


## this will actually be the varying Mdot procedure
* measure the rotation rate of the accretor, assuming it rotates as a solid body, angular momentum goes as GMR then measure Jdot (rate of ang mom increase), then assuming a solid body, estimate the rotation rate (it should spin up with mass accretion, this is also true in the constant case)
* give them the interpolation script most likely? - could ask them to put it in - might have them write certain parts and then give them other parts
* runs to helium flash in about 7 minutes it seems - got mad about hydro stuff and adjusted corrections
* use whichever history file from lab 1 that they used - need a second spreadsheet for that
* still want to look at the thickness of the helium burning shell - could use an average Mdot (mass accreted - could store this in the history file columns - might even be a default value vs time taken)
* the default one is called star_Mdot - can simply call that








## RCB - WD merger
* ?? entropy injection - Courtney task: does this work? Does it take too long? Can we speed it up?
* Give them an entropy injection routine - could maybe write a functional form if it’s not too complicated
* Evolve a normal star first - could be given to speed up, but it really doesn’t take long
* Give them abundances - unless change M and q??
* Evolve to RCB phase ? could take forever - lower some resolutions - could turn off reactions???? - super adiabatic reduction new thing in MESA for slowdown
* Needs work - could be abandoned
* Could this be also accretion - a lot of work on us but would be cool!
