Here is a landing page that we will hopefully update later :)

<b>Important Note:</b> The MESA documentation links throughout this lab will point to version <code>r24.03.1</code> as there is going to be a new MESA revision shortly after the workshop begins. If you are looking at this documentation in the future, you will want to make sure you navigate to the latest version of the MESA documentation instead of this specific version.
