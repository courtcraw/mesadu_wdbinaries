Here is the text for lab 1

## Run binary as point mass - goal is to get Mdot as a function of time
* Start from an inlist that we give them for a generic binary, then changing the parameters: component masses and separation
* Run speedup options - could be given or asked to add in
* Ask them to save to history file the Mdot and time (visualize this in pgstar - write their own pgstar with history data)
* Claudia task: run a few and play around
* Main concern is runtime for some parameters, solver may struggle
* Science goal: connect types of donors to Mdot and Mdot to thickness of Helium shell



* claudia timed this on 6 cores with default and it ran in 7 ish minutes
* could lower the time resolution - esp with those for the lower number of threads to do a crowdsourced convergence study - how do we compare these between the different types
* google collab with scripts on it to plot history files on the fly
* vary the separation and mass ratios and the total mass - Sunny will generate donor models for this
* there will be roughly 13 groups, 39 attendees




* he-wd masses 0.1-0.2 ish solar masses
* co-wd base model is 1 Msol, 0.8 - 1 solar mass generally (for those that are interesting)
