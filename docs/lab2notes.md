# TA notes

Bonus task: run through helium flash over lunch time if you wish. - see the heating timescale getting short (some cases where the heating timescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale or the sound speed, there is a time where the heating timescale gets long)

* Could add str_ptr mixing_type (0 to 7, 1=convection), to find the mass of the convective zone rather than just using 10^3 or 4 in our case (this is a different estimate than the pure subtraction)

* Court note: not done yet but closer than before. running with updated rates and network runs at 3 min runtime on 4 cores

adjust the reaction network to add in the reaction chain $$^{14}N(e^-,\nu)^{14}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{18}O$$ which we will call the NCO reaction.
* [link to the networks docs](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/net/nets.html)

* Courtney note: okay I've been playing with this and I think all we need is to add c14 and o18 to the list of isos, and then I assume the reaction will automatically be added. Evan Bauer's paper has a more complicated patch, but I would assume that got fixed after the version update (they used r8118 lol)
* there is now a test_suite case called custom_rates that implements the updated reaction rate used in the Bauer paper if we wanted to do that?? 
* I need to figure out if or how you would make the reaction chain into its own group for outputting the energy generated by just this reaction chain
<code>add_isos(
c14
o18)</code>

* outputting the energy generated by this reaction should be fairly simple to do using profile_defaults, but then what do we do with that? do we care?
* have them add in the reaction rates
* at 10^-8 rates you should check to see the NCO is actually working by looking for o18 in the star abundance profile

## Potentially, run a constant mass accretion onto the accretor in single star
* Fairly easy task 
* Give them a WD model, and they add in a constant mass accretion which is just an inlist parameter
* Evolve to helium flash
* Goal is to record the total helium mass at helium flash as a function of Mdot (crowdsourced) - see Evan Bauer paper
* Science idea: strength of helium flash as a function of He thickness - whether there is He detonation is a function of the He shell thickness


## notes from newest meeting
* edit reaction network - adding N14 changes some stuff (adding a few reactions can change the thickness of the helium burning shell necessary for the flash) and would be the first one to do reaction networks in the workshop
* recreate fig 4 from Evan Bauer paper with crowd sourcing
* ask them to measure the reaction timescale and compare to the sound crossing time (aka is it super-sonic burning)
* ignition is L_nuc > 10^4-3 Lsol, or when there is a convection zone in the shell (this can be the stopping condition)
* bonus task is to just let it keep running through the whole helium flash
* second potential bonus task is to let it run through with time dependent convection prescriptions - could run this over lunchtime
* rates are between 10^-8 to 10^-7 (tends to decrease in runtime with higher mass transfer rates)
