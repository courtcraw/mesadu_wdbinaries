Here is the text for lab 2


## Potentially, run a constant mass accretion onto the accretor in single star
* Fairly easy task 
* Give them a WD model, and they add in a constant mass accretion which is just an inlist parameter
* Evolve to helium flash
* Goal is to record the total helium mass at helium flash as a function of Mdot (crowdsourced) - see Evan Bauer paper
* Science idea: strength of helium flash as a function of He thickness - whether there is He detonation is a function of the He shell thickness


## Mdot over time accretion from part 1 of lab onto donor
* Given a WD model, and then they’ll write (or maybe we’ll give) extras_start_step for mass accretion - probably give interpolation code in fortran to read the history file
* Tryston task: write interpolation code
* Evolve to helium flash - maybe (if possible)
* Goal is to record the total helium mass at helium flash as a function of Mdot (crowdsourced) - see Evan Bauer paper
* More realistic look at what stars actually do before helium flash
