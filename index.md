# Markdown and HTML stuff stolen from May

In the following `MESA` lab exercises, you will see different text boxes and colours appearing at different times. <br>

Text boxes with black background will provide either some terminal commands or terminal output from your `MESA` and `GYRE` runs. (Courtney note this DOES NOT WORK in our github pages theme!!)

<div class="terminal-title"> Terminal commands or output </div> 
<div class="terminal"><p>
A terminal command or output will appear here
</p></div>


The second type of text box has a white background, and lists example contents of different files that you need to use/modify or `fortran` coding examples.

<div class="filetext-title"> File name or type of fortran commands </div> 
<div class="filetext"><p>
Text inside file or example fortran coding snippets go here.
</p></div>


Aside from the two types of text boxes, there are three different types of coloured text that you will need to pay attention to. <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r23.05.1/" target="_blank"> Text of this colour can be clicked</a> and will either take you to a website or give you downloadable content that you need for the exercise, including solutions to Minilab 1, Minilab 2, and the Maxilab. The remaining two types of text colours correspond to specific tasks that you have to complete and some useful hints along the way, click on them to expand the task or hint.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
